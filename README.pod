This project connects Github Users to MetaCPAN Users. It uses the
APIs of both sites: First it fetches all users from MetaCPAN who
have set their Github account. After that it fetches all public
information about these users from Github. The app is deployed to
dotCloud and uses MongoDB for storing the data. The software is
written in Perl using the Mojolicious framework.

It's some sort of an index of CPAN authors and their Github
accounts.
