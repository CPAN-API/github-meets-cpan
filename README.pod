This project connects Github Users to
L<MetaCPAN|https://metacpan.org> Users. It uses the
APIs of both sites: First it fetches all users from
L<MetaCPAN|https://metacpan.org> who have set their
Github account. After that it fetches all public information
about these users from Github. The app is deployed to
L<http://dotcloud.com> and uses L<MongoDB|http://www.mongodb.org/>
for storing the data. The software is written in Perl using the
L<Mojolicious|https://github.com/kraih/mojo> framework.

It's some sort of an index of CPAN authors and their Github
accounts.
