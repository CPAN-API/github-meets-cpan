    "GitHub Meets CPAN" presents a list of users who have set their <a
    href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> account at <a
    href="https://metacpan.org">MetaCPAN</a>. This app uses the <a
    href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/blob/master/docs/API-docs.md">MetaCPAN
    API</a> as well as the <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub
    API</a> (<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Pithub">Pithub</a>) to gather
    all the information presented here. It is hosted by the MetaCPAN project
    and uses the <a href="http://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious Web
    Framework</a>. <a href="http://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> provides the
    caching layer which makes it so fast.  You can <a
    href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/github-meets-cpan">fork this project on
    GitHub</a>.  The guy who was so bored to write this is called <a href="<%=
    url_for '/user/PLU' %>">plu</a>. The rank is calculated by this
    formula:<br/>

    <pre>  (count of your followers)
+ (sum of watchers of all of your repositories)
+ (sum of forks of all of your repositories)
= rank</pre>
    <p>Currently there are <%= $count %> users listed.</p>
    <p>To appear on this list, you need to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Have an account on <a href="https://metacpan.org">MetaCPAN</a>.
    <li>Have an account on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.
    <li>Edit your <a href="https://metacpan.org/account/profile">MetaCPAN profile</a>.
        At the bottom you'll find a <strong>Profiles</strong> section.
        Select GitHub from the drop-down menu and put your github username in the text box that appears.
        Click on the <em>check</em> link to the right to make sure you got that right.
