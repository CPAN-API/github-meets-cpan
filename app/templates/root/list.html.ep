    Here's a list of users who have set their <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>
    account at <a href="https://metacpan.org">MetaCPAN</a>. This app uses the
    <a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/Beta-API-docs">MetaCPAN API</a>
    as well as the <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">Github API</a>
    (<a href="https://github.com/plu/Pithub">Pithub</a>) to gather all the information
    presented here. It is hosted at <a href="http://dotcloud.com">dotCloud</a> and uses the
    <a href="http://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious Web Framework</a>. The guy who was so
    bored to write this is called <a href="<%= url_for '/user/PLU' %>">plu</a>. The
    rank is calculated by this formula:<br/>
    <pre>  (count of your followers)
+ (sum of watchers of all of your repositories)
+ (sum of forks of all of your repositories)
= rank</pre>
    <p>Currently there are <%= $users->count %> users listed.</p>
